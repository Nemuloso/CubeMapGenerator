# Environment Map Generator
## Description
This tool is designed to provide a simple way converting equirectangular HDR maps to a set of IBL cubemaps.
The created cubemaps are saved as sets of six single images each. That way they are ready to use in the [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) framework.
