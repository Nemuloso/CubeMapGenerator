<h1>Environment Map Generator<h1>
<h2>Description<h2>
This tool is designed to provide a simple way converting spherical HDR Maps to a set of IBL maps. Actually the created cubemaps are saved as sets of six single images each. So they are ready to use in the three.js framework https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/.
